FizzBuzz kata (easy)

For a natural number greater than zero return:<br>

-"fizz" if the number is dividable by 3 <br>
-"buzz" if the number is dividable by 5 <br>
-"fizzbuzz" if the number is dividable by 15 <br>
-return the same number if no other requrement is fullfilled <br>

Note:<br>
Remember to use JUnit 5 (org.junit.jupiter), 'mvn test' should be then work.
Also you probably will need to configure the IDE to work with JUnit if pom doesn't help.
