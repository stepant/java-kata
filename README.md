FizzBuzz kata (easy)

For a natural number greater than zero return:

-"fizz" if the number is dividable by 3 
-"buzz" if the number is dividable by 5 
-"fizzbuzz" if the number is dividable by 15 
-return the same number if no other requrement is fullfilled 

Note:
Remember to use JUnit 5 (org.junit.jupiter), 'mvn test' should be then work.
Also you probably will need to configure the IDE to work with JUnit if pom doesn't help.
